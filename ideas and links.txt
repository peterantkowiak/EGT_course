Tasks:
Reproduce 

compare the effect of spatial structure on the persistence of cooperators in the in the PD and HD games

change the size of the neighbourhood in the spatial games and analyse how that affects the persistence of cooperators.
-> moore-neighbourhood (8), von Neumann (4) & an even bigger one

Implement mixed (stochastic) strategies in the spatial and non-spatial HD games. Compare the effect of spatial structure with pure and mixed strategies.
-> introduce mutation rate similar to ants game
