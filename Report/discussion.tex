\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

\subsection{Main findings}

\subsubsection*{Spatial structure}

compare the effect of spatial structure on the persistence of cooperators in PD and HD !!! see paper!!!

\subsubsection*{Different neighborhood sizes}


spatial HD: cooperation extinguishing threshold $1 / N > 1 - r$
spatial PD: Ohtsuki et al 2006

very small neighborhoods (4) are not sufficiently as capable to reduce exploitation from defectors as bigger ones
turning point / other processes

\subsubsection*{Mixed strategies}

compare the effect of spatial structure in the mixed-strategy HD game with that in the pure-strategy game





``What does cooperation mean in die Hawk-Dove game?''

\\
--> two variables influence whether a system is stable: neighborhood size and cost-benefit ratio

\\
(Ohtsuki et al 2006:
 ``natural selection favours cooperation, if the
 benefit of the altruistic act, b, divided by the cost, c, exceeds the
 average number of neighbours, k, which means b/c > k. In this
 case, cooperation can evolve as a consequence of ‘social viscosity’
 even in the absence of reputation effects or strategic complexity.'')
 

\subsection{Limitations}
While gender and age do not have a significant influence on attitude, answers differ significantly among places where the interviews were conducted. We therefore assume that the selection of interview sites is relevant for the outcome. Due to the limited time and number of researchers in our study, our results can not be fully generalized. For reproducing our study on a large scale one should aim to select the interviewees as representative as possible.\\
Besides the selection of interview sites, the scheme of interviews might constitute a certain limitation to our study. As the interviews were conducted orally, the responses might be influenced by interactions between interviewer and interviewees. For example, interviewees might attribute a pro-refugee opinion to the interviewer and therefore not be honest when having a different opinion themselves. This goes especially for interviewers speaking English. Interviewees might assume that they are talking to migrants and might therefore not want to express a negative attitude towards refugees. Several times it occurred that interviewees were in company of other people who would try to influence the answers by making comments. Although we explicitly asked the interviewees for their personal opinion, the results may have been biased in some cases. To increase objectivity and avoid bias by personal interactions, one could switch to anonymized printed questionnaires in future studies.\\

\subsection{Final conclusions, applications and further research}

\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{spatial structure does not automatically make a system stable}}\\
	\item{\textbf{two variables influence whether a system is stable: neighborhood size and cost-benefit ratio}}
\end{itemize}


\begin{comment}
In conclusion, we found that people who oppose hosting more refugees tend to overestimate the real numbers whereas people who favor hosting more refugees tend to underestimate the real numbers. However, our data do not support a correlation between precision of estimate and attitude. We cannot tell from our data if this means that subtle perception rather than knowledge influences people's attitude towards refugees. We therefore recommend further investigating this question with a more differentiated questionnaire that incorporates a well-defined proxy for the interviewees knowledge on refugees.\\
While gender and age did not significantly influence attitude in our study, answers differed significantly among places where the interviews were conducted. When reproducing this study, places for the interviews should be selected so that they represent an average of the population. Furthermore, we recommend using printed questionnaires to ensure objective and honest answers.


It is widely assumed that spatial structure allows for the evolution of cooperation in PD games. However, this goes only for a small range of cost-benefit ratios. Cooperation is only evolutionarily stable for r-values $ \leq 0.09$, for bigger r-values it disappears from the population.\\

In spatial HD games: small neighborhoods = bigger profit when r is small, and small neighborhoods = bigger disadvantage when r is big.

In spatial PD games: 

Found anomality

r 0.03, nb4 -> stable at propC 0.35 after 2500 steps -> stable
r 0.065, nb4 -> cooperators die after 900 steps -> unstable
r 0.03, nb8 -> stable at propC 0.77 after 10000 steps -> stable
r 0.065, nb8 -> stable at propC 0.55 after 2500 steps -> stable
r 0.03, nb12 -> stable at propC 0.825 after 7500 steps -> stable
r 0.065, nb12 -> randomly oscillating around propC 0.33 after 10000 steps -> half-stable
r 0.03, nb24 -> stable at propC 0.85 after 4000 steps -> stable
r 0.065, nb 24 -> cooperators die after 7400 steps -> unstable


fixed r: at 0.03 and 0.065
varying neighborhood size
5000 steps, 5 repetitions
