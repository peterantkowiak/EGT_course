  abstract = {Understanding the emergence of cooperation is a fundamental problem
	in evolutionary biology(1). Evolutionary game theory(2,3) has become
	a powerful framework with which to investigate this problem. Two
	simple games have attracted most attention in theoretical and experimental
	studies: the Prisoner's Dilemma(4) and the snowdrift game (also known
	as the hawk-dove or chicken game)(5). In the Prisoner's Dilemma,
	the non-cooperative state is evolutionarily stable, which has inspired
	numerous investigations of suitable extensions that enable cooperative
	behaviour to persist. In particular, on the basis of spatial extensions
	of the Prisoner's Dilemma, it is widely accepted that spatial structure
	promotes the evolution of cooperation(6-8). Here we show that no
	such general predictions can be made for the effects of spatial structure
	in the snowdrift game. In unstructured snowdrift games, intermediate
	levels of cooperation persist. Unexpectedly, spatial structure reduces
	the proportion of cooperators for a wide range of parameters. In
	particular, spatial structure eliminates cooperation if the cost-to-benefit
	ratio of cooperation is high. Our results caution against the common
	belief that spatial structure is necessarily beneficial for cooperative
	behaviour.},
